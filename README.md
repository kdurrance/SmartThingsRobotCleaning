# SmartThingsRobotCleaning
Groovy code to switch SmartThings Modes based on the accelerometer sensor in a SmartThings Multi Sensor

Step 1. Tape a SmartThings Multi Sensor inside the dustbin of your Neato/Roomba etc.
Step 2. Create a new "Mode" in SmartThings called "Robot Cleaning" or similar. In this mode, disable motion sensors in the house
Step 3. Add this SmartApp. Configure the SmartApp only to run in "Away and Robot Cleaning" modes
Step 4. Enjoy automatic mode switching, and stop your robot from setting off your motion sensor :)
